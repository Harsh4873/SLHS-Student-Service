# SLHS-Student-Service
## An app that helps all types of students - incoming and current students in high school. Our app provides tremendous scheduling features and shareability features so students can interact with other students and learn about how their classes will schedule in together with their lunch in high school. 
## Furthermore, our app provides 6 different sections that the users can go through and work with in the app: 
* Home 
* Calendar 
* Lunch Menu
* Your Schedule 
* Extracurriculars 
* Contact Staff 

## There is also ways for the user to connect to social media and share their schedules with other students. Also, if there is ever any bug or error in our app there is a simple contact support option in the the contact staff button that will help the user with that.
